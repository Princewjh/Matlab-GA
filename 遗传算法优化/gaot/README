This directory contains the Genetic Algorithm Optimization Toolbox for
Matlab 5.

To use this, if you are local to NCSU and have AFS access to this
directory, simply extend the matlab path using the following command.
You can also place this command in a file called startup.m.  Everytime
you start Matlab in the directory containing this file, the path will
always be extended.

>>path(path,'/afs/eos/service/ie/research/kay_res/GAToolBox/gaot');

Otherwise, install the .m files into a directory named gaot and extend
the matlab path to that directory.  The compressed tar archive and the
zip file should automatically create the gaot directory for you.

The companion paper describing this toolbox is included here as
gaotv5.ps. The paper, the three demo files, gademo1.m gademo2.m
gademo3.m, and four example scripts, binaryExample, floatExample,
floatGradExample, and orderbasedExample, should be sufficient
explanation of this toolbox.  For any questions, comments, suggestions
send mail to jjoine@eos.ncsu.edu.

For a list of the files in the tool box get help on gaot.

Thanks for trying the toolbox.
