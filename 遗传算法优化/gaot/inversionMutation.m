function [child] = inversionMutation(par,bounds,genInfo,Ops)
% Inversion mutation  inverts the bits or permutation between two
% cut points.
%
% function [newSol] = inversionMutation(parent,bounds,Ops)
% parent  - the first parent ( [solution string function value] )
% bounds  - the bounds matrix for the solution space
% Ops     - Options for binaryMutation [gen prob_of_mutation]
